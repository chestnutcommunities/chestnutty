            <p>
                This is the privacy notice of Mobile Game Central. In this document, “we” or “us” refers to
                Chestnut Software Studios Limited.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are company number 3693177 registered in New Zealand.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a notice to tell you our policy about all information that we record about you. It
                covers both information that could identify you and information that could not.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are extremely concerned to protect your privacy and confidentiality. We understand that all
                users of our web site are quite rightly concerned to know that their data will not be used
                for any purpose unintended by them, and will not accidentally fall into the hands of a third
                party. Our policy is both specific and strict. It complies with New Zealand law
                and with the laws of all jurisdictions of which we are aware. If you think our policy falls
                short of your expectations or that we are failing to abide by our policy, <strong>do please 
                tell us</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We regret that if there are one or more points below with which you are not happy, your only
                recourse is to leave our web site immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
                Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any personally
                identifiable information collected at this site.
